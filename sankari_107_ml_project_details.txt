Calories Burnt Prediction Project:
Details of the datasets:
1. In this project, we have 2 datasets. One contains calories and another contains [User_ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, Body_Temp].
1.1 we analyzed, what happens when we exercise.
1.2 the body temperature will increase during the exercise.
1.3 How many calories are burnt during the exercise that is what we are going to predict by this model.
1.4 Heart rate is the indirect measurement of that person doing exercises how much time?
2. Workflow:

 data sets----> Data preprocessing ------> Data Analysis-----> Train test split----->XGBoostRegressor ---->Evaluation

3. Importing the dependencies

4. Data collection and preprocessing:
4.1 load the two datasets. (exercise and calorie datasets)
4.2 Combine the two datasets by concatenation method.
4.3 Check the shape of the dataset.
4.4 getting some basic information about the dataset.
4.5 Checking for missing values.

5. Data Analysis:
5.1 Getting some basic statistical measures about the dataset.
5.2 People who do exercise Agewise minimum 20 to 79.
5.3 People who do exercise Heightwise minimum of 123 to 222
5.4 People who do exercise weigh a minimum of 36 to 132
5.5 People who do exercise duration minimum 1min to 30min
5.6 People who do exercise Heart_rate minimum 67 to 128
5.7 People who do exercise body_temp minimum 37 to 41

6. Visualization of the Analysis:
6.1 distribution of the gender column for analyzing the comparsion of data points for male and female
6.2 distribution of age column
6.3 distribution of duration column
6.4 compare the duration and calories column
6.5 compare the body temperature and calories column
6.6 find the correlation in the dataset
6.7 constructing the heatmap to understand the correlation

7. splitting from data into feature data and targeted data

8. splitting the data for train and test.

9. model training:XGBoostRegressor

10. Predict the test data by absolute mean error: 1.4833678883314132. This is a very good value which very close to the y_test.

11. make the predictive system to predict the "calories burnt"
